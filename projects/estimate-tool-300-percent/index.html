<blockquote>
  <p>Work at Marble.com (All Granite &amp; Marble Corp). Numbers are approximate. Internal details omitted out of respect for the company.</p>

<p>The online estimate tool went through three generations over roughly a decade. I was involved in all three.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-started">How it started</h2>

<p>The first version was Flash — I owned the UX, coordinated the build, reviewed the API docs, and made sure the ERP pricing pulled correctly. When Flash started losing browser support around 2013–2015, I pushed for a migration before it became a crisis.</p>

<p>Version two was Angular. Same role on my side. When Angular’s own support cycle ended years later, another migration became unavoidable.</p>

<p>For version three the developer chose Pixi.js — that wasn’t my call. But the project stalled, and I stepped in to lead it through to completion.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-actually-changed">What I actually changed</h2>

<p>Every version had carried over too much complexity from the one before. Too many shape options, too many steps, too much that needed explanation. I watched real customers come into the office and struggle with it. Hotjar confirmed what I was seeing.</p>

<p>The core fix was simple: <strong>99% of marble jobs are a rectangle or an L-shape</strong>. I cut everything else. Two shapes, cleaner steps, nothing that didn’t need to be there.</p>

<p>I checked every decision with the sales team — they knew exactly where customers gave up. And I kept watching real people use it until the drop-offs stopped.</p>

<p>One deliberate choice: email and phone at the end stayed optional. No gate.</p>

<h2 id="what-happened">What happened</h2>

<p>Completions jumped <strong>+300%</strong>, quickly. People started coming into the office with the emailed estimate already in hand — that hadn’t happened before. More of them left their contact details voluntarily, even though we never required it.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-took-from-it">What I took from it</h2>

<p>Watching someone actually use the thing is worth more than any stakeholder meeting. And “fewer options” is almost always the right answer when the task is narrow — the edge cases aren’t worth the friction they create for everyone else.</p>
